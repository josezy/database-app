# Monadical Take-Home Project

<img src="https://nicksweeting.com/database.png" width="300px"/>

## Task

Your task is to extend this small example app with a few more features and nicer CSS:

1. Add the ability to remove rows by clicking an "X" button in the row
2. Add the ability to download the data as a JSON file
3. Make the page look nicer using a CSS framework like:
    - Bootstrap
    - Semantic UI
    - Material Design
    - UIKit
    - Pure.CSS
    - or another framework of your choice

You may also add any other features you think would be a good idea in this database app, but be careful not to over-engineer it.  You're also welcome to name the page something other than "Database" if you want to give it a catchy name, color scheme, or logo (although it's not a requirement).

It's estimated to take between 1hr and 3hrs depending on how much time you spend doing CSS.

## We're looking for:

1. functional, clean, minimalist code design that extends the existing code
2. good-looking UI & UX that's easy to use

Be careful not to over-engineer, and make sure to match the style of the existing code unless you have a good reason to change it.

## Folder Structure

```
example-project/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
  src/
    index.js
    index.css
    ... other javascript files, images, fonts, etc
```


## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Adding Images, Fonts, and Files

You can **`import` a file right in a JavaScript module**. This tells the build system (Webpack) to include that file in the bundle. Importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path you can reference in your code, e.g. as the `src` attribute of an image or the `href` of a link to a PDF.

Here is an example:

```js
import React from 'react'
import logo from './logo.png' // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image

const Header = () =>
    <img src={logo} alt="Logo"/>
```
